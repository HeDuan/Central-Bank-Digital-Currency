## Introduction
Central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the digital form of fiat money which is a currency established as money by government regulation or law. CDBC combines the characteristics of central bank currency and digital currency-centralization and distributed book-keeping. CBDC is only a hypothetical model till now.

## Birth defects of CBDC
Private digital currency develops rapidly in the post-financial crisis era under the background of global currency competitiveness overrun, but the inherent defects of private digital currency make it unable to become a real currency.

### 1.Instability of Value
The market price of digital money is very unstableï¼Œ so it cannot be used as store of value. Bitcoin prices have risen all the way since the beginning of 2017, reaching an all-time high of $19373.14 on December 16, 2017, and then began to fall, falling to $1348.02 at the lowest level, with a maximum decline of 16.72%, the biggest drop since January 2015. The price of ET coin has changed more dramatically, rising nearly 90 times in 2017. The sharp rise and fall of Bitcoin and the rapid rise of the Ethernet coin reflect the great volatility of the private digital money market.
