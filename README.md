## Introduction
Central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the digital form of fiat money which is a currency established as money by government regulation or law. CDBC combines the characteristics of central bank currency and digital currency-centralization and distributed book-keeping. CBDC is only a hypothetical model till now.

## Birth defects of CBDC
Private digital currency develops rapidly in the post-financial crisis era under the background of global currency competitiveness overrun, but the inherent defects of private digital currency make it unable to become a real currency.

### 1.Instability of Value
The market price of digital money is very unstable for it does not have country credit endorsement, so it cannot be used as store of value. Bitcoin prices have risen all the way since the beginning of 2017, reaching an all-time high of $19373.14 on December 16, 2017, and then began to fall, falling to $1348.02 at the lowest level, with a maximum decline of 16.72%, the biggest drop since January 2015. The price of ET coin has changed more dramatically, rising nearly 90 times in 2017. The sharp rise and fall of Bitcoin and the rapid rise of the Ethernet coin reflect the great volatility of the private digital money market.

### 2.Low transaction validation rate
The transaction validation rate of digital currency is very low, so it cannot be used as Medium of exchange. In Bitcoin system, broadcasting information transmission and hashing operations take a lot of computing power and time. As a result, the overall service processing capacity of Bitcoin system is limited. It is estimated that only seven services can be processed per second, while the average number of services processed by Visa is between 2000 and 7000.

### 3. Fixed and limited money supply
The money supply of digital currency is fixed and limited, so money policy cannot be implemented. In the Bitcoin system, the money supply increases with time, and the increased Bitcoins are acquired by the "excellent miners" who have the strongest computing power in an operation cycle. However, the total number of Bitcoins is about 21 million, and the growth mechanism is relatively stylized. The number of Bitcoins produced each time is relatively fixed and lack of controllability.

### 4. Difficult to effectively supervise
n some payment scenarios, private digital currency can replace legal currency for payment, but private digital currency is not controlled by the central bank. If the use of private digital money exceeds a certain limit, it will affect the implementation and transmission of the central bank's monetary policy. At the same time, the great volatility of the value of private digital currency makes it easy to cause market panic and risk events, and poses a threat to the stability of the financial system. In addition, private digital currency generally has the characteristics of anonymity, unregulated funds and transnational flows, which may encourage illegal traders to use private digital currency to cover up their real trading intentions, and enterprises and individuals to use private digital currency to achieve the purpose of tax evasion and tax evasion. However, in the field of private digital currency, the absence of regulation is serious, and it is difficult for relevant departments to effectively supervise private digital currency.
